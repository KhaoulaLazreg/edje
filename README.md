# Overview
The goal of the Edje project is to define a standard high-level Java API called Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for 
accessing hardware features delivered by microcontrollers such as GPIO, DAC, ADC, PWM, MEMS, UART, CAN, Network, LCD, 
etc. that can directly connect to native libraries, drivers and board support packages provided by silicon vendors 
with their evaluation kits.
